Sudden wealth means getting wealth suddenly.
However, earning more money from a better job means getting wealth gradually
Like salary man
I prefer earning than sudden
Because earning gain money slowly, so it contains how to use the money.
However sudden get a lot of money at once
So you may use the money thoughtlessly
In fact, there are some people who had won the lottery and got poor immediatley
But if I get a chance of sudden wealth, I won't refuse it
I think Sudden wealth is better than nothing
